# friendui

A Clojure library designed to wrap cemerick's `friend` ([_https://github.com/cemerick/friend_]) library.
It provides templates for login / signup with email activation. Additionally there is an admin interface where one can
edit existing users or add new ones.

## Dependencies
* enlive (v1.1.5) as templating library.
* friend (0.2.1)
* Bootstrap (> 3.0) is required too if you want it to look nice.

## "Installation"

Friendui is available in Clojars:
[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/de.sveri/friendui/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/de.sveri/friendui)

## Related
There is an implementation for this which uses SQL Korma as a backend: <https://github.com/sventechie/friendui-sql>. It uses JDBC; MySQL and PostgreSQL schemas are provided, and other DBs could be supported too if you customize the schemas.

## Usage

### Config
Friendui looks for a configuration file named: `friendui-config.edn` in the classpath.
An example config can be found here: [_https://github.com/sveri/friend-ui/blob/master/dev-resources/friendui-config.edn_]


Then you have to alter the root binding of the base template var like this:

```clojure
(:require [de.sveri.friendui.globals :as f-global])

(html/deftemplate base (str template-path "base.html")
                  [{:keys [title content]}]
                  [:#title] (util/maybe-content title)         ; this corresponds to the :base-template-title-key key in the config
                  [:#content] (util/maybe-substitute content)) ; this corresponds to the :base-template-content-key key in the config

(alter-var-root #'f-global/base-template (fn [_] (partial base)))
```

### E-Mail
Friendui supports two different ways of sending email which are configured in *friendui-config.edn* by the `:mail-type` tag.
1. *:sendmail* Expects a running sendmail on `localhost` by which the mail will be delivered.
2. *:smtp* An extra *:smtp-data* map must be provided in the config which is passed as is to `postal`: [_https://github.com/drewr/postal_]

### Protocol
And finally you have to implement a protocol to retrieve and store user data:

```clojure
(defprotocol FrienduiStorage
  "Defines methods to access user storage for retrieval and update."
  (account-activated? [this activationid]
                      "Provides an id. Expects a boolean return value indicating if the user, belonging to the id is
                      activated or not.")
  (activate-account [this activationid]
                    "Should set the user with the given id to activated. After this function was called successfully
                    (account-activated?) should return true.")
  (create-user [this email password role activationid]
               "Should add a new user to your data store. Return value is not checked.")
  (get-all-users [this]
                 "Called from the admin view. Expects a list of all known users in this format:
                 ({:user/activated false, :user/role :user/admin, :user/email unique-email@host.com}
                 ...)
                 Where each key corresponds to the configured keyword from friendui-config.edn")
  (get-user-for-activation-id [this id]
                              "Should return a map containing the username and role of this user like this:
                              {:username username :roles #{role}}")
  (update-user [this username data-map]
               "Updates the user with the given data map of the form: {:user/activated boolean :user/role :user/free}")
  (username-exists? [this username]
                    "Expects true if the username exists already in the storage, false otherwise."))
```

Then you pass this storage to the `friendui` routes like this:
```clojure
(:require [de.sveri.friendui.routes.user :refer [friend-routes]])

(defroutes allroutes
    (friend-routes FrienduiStorageImpl)
    ...)

(def app
  (handler/site
    (friend/authenticate allroutes friend-settings)))
```


### Your friend settings
Of course you have to define your friend settings yourself in your application, this is an example of mine:
```clojure
(def friend-settings
  {:credential-fn             (partial creds/bcrypt-credential-fn user/login-user)
   :workflows                 [(workflows/interactive-form)]
   :login-uri                 "/user/login"
   :unauthorized-redirect-uri "/user/login"
   :default-landing-uri       "/"})
```

This should get you up and running.

## Provided Resources:

```clojure
(GET "/user/login")   ; expects a "username" / "password" combination
(GET "/user/signup")
(POST "/user/signup") ; expects email / password / confirm parameters
(GET "/user/accountcreated")
(GET "/user/activate/:id")
(GET "/user/accountactivated")
(GET "/user/admin" [filter])
(POST "/user/update" [username role active])
(POST "/user/add" [email password confirm]) ; used in admin view
(ANY "/user/logout")
```

## Callback functions
Friendui provides support for callback functions. These are called under certain circumstances.
You can pass them as a map to the `friend-routes` function like this:
```clojure
(friend-routes (db/FrienduiStorageImpl db-conn) {:signup-succ-func (fn [] (println "succ func"))})
```

Currently these two are supported:
* `signup-succ-func` Called after a successfull signup - no arguments
* `activate-account-succ-func` Called after a successful user activation, takes a user map as argument
(provides `username` and `roles` key)
